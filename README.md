# Normal Dream MSE exporters

Extra exporters for use in Magic Set Editor

Written by Normal Dream (Djack Donovan)


<!-- INSTALL GUIDE -->
## Install Guide

1. Download and extract [this zip file](https://github.com/djackddonovan/mse-cockatrice-v4-exporter/archive/master.zip).

2. Copy `data` and `magicseteditor - EXPORTER UPDATE.exe` into your mse install folder.

3. Launch `magicseteditor - EXPORTER UPDATE.exe`, go to `File > Export > HTML ...` and select "Cockatrice Database v4" or "Print Sheet" (due to a bug in the exporter update version, "HTML ..." only shows up as a globe).

Some additions have been made to mse that are necessary to run the exporter. Once the next version of mse comes around, "magicseteditor - EXPORTER UPDATE.exe" won't be needed anymore. (Those changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2/compare/master...djackddonovan:MagicSetEditor2:master).)

To use standalone, save the export into the Cockatrice folder located in Users (C:\\Users\[ACCOUNT_NAME]\App Data\Local; App Data may be hidden!)
	change the file path to your file under settings in Cockatrice (Cockatrice will need to restart!) (untested)
